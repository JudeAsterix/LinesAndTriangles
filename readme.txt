Things to do
-Connect intersecting points with a line
-Connect triple-intersecting points with a line
-Change the epsilion easily
-Be able to input some data from a spreadsheet
-Be able output the double and triple intersections
-Have togglable visibilty of the epsilion squares.
-Have a reset function

-Connecting Lines
Josh recommended creating a table to deal with points. Consider the following table.

 |A|B|C|D|E|F|G|
A|-|t|f|t|f|f|f|
B|-|-|f|t|f|f|f|
C|-|-|-|f|t|f|t| t - true f - false
D|-|-|-|-|t|f|f|
E|-|-|-|-|-|t|f|
F|-|-|-|-|-|-|f|
G|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|

Simply put, if a cell is true, there is a connection between the points of the row and column the cell lives in.
Using this chart, it's relatively easy to find
